# EverParse: A Tool for Verified Low-level Parsing and Formatting

EverParse is a framework for generating verified secure parsers and
formatters from DSL format specification languages.

At the core of EverParse is _LowParse_, a verified combinator library
programmed in F\*. Additionally, we have two frontend DSLs in which to
specify input data formats. _QuackyDucky_ accepts data formats in a
style common to many RFCs. The _3d_ frontend allows specifying data
formats in an style resembling type definitions in the C programming
language.
