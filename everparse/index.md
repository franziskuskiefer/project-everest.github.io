EverParse is a framework for generating verified secure parsers and
formatters from domain-specific format specification languages.

The framework contains three components:

*LowParse*: At the core of EverParse is _LowParse_, a verified library
of parsing and formatting combinators programmed and verified in F\*.

*QuackyDucky*: Our first frontend for EverParse accepts data formats
in a style common to many RFCs. We have used it to generate message
processing code for several networking protocols, including TLS and
QUIC.

*3D*: Our second frontend for EverParse enables specifying data
formats in an style resembling type definitions in the C programming
language. We have used it to generate message validation code for use
within several low-level C programs.
